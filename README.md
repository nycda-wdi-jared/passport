# Passport

* Authentication Middleware
* http://www.passportjs.org/

* Both examples here are using jQuery for the front-end framework
* The difference between the two examples is:
	* One uses the pgClient and one file for the passport functions and routing
	* One uses sequelize and two files, one for the passport & one for the routing

In these lessons:
* Make sure to create a user and a profile for that user.
* You can use the ui for the user
* Use postman to create a profile
